So I checked out a Google search of myself and I'm very glad I did. I was surprised to find I actually had a twitter account from 2011 with about 15 tweets, one embarrassing one, which was highlighted in the second search result. That account is now deleted and hopefully the search will update soon. Otherwise, I have a very low internet presence and I would like to keep it that way, even with a tech job. I think it's perfectly reasonable. 
I have a linkedin account at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-k-a73b61181/
and a faceplace account at: https://www.facebook.com/paul.kutrich/
